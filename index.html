            <p> Floods wreak havoc in Assam every year, and this year has been no different.
                The flood situation in the Northeast looks grim with Assam and Meghalaya emerging as the worst-hit.
                Lower Assam has been one of the worst-hit with five major rivers flowing above danger level. Assam has
                been
                reeling under devastating floods with 32 of the northeastern state's 33 districts now inundated by
                floods.

                Centre faces questions over BJP's pre-poll promise to make Assam flood-free.
                Entire states Flooded but PM Modi busy in toppling Maharashtra govt'
                (no one cares). Our government has gone blind for power, and only power is everything for them. Assam’s
                devastating annual ‘catastrophe’ remains unheared and unreported. There have been promises but no
                results , no solutions.

                Assam is located in the northeast of India.

                third-largest producer of petroleum and natural gas in the country and has ample reserves of limestone.
                , the state is a biodiversity hotspot

                    <p id="first">Guwahati: Assam's flood situation remained bleak with all major rivers in spate, affecting over 47 lakh people and claiming 11 more lives, as Union Home Minister Amit Shah called up Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to enquire about the state of affairs, officials said.
                        The state has been reeling under devastating floods over the last one week, impacting 47,72,140 people in 32 of the 36 districts.
                        
                        The fresh fatalities have pushed the death count in this year's floods and landslides in Assam to 82, a bulletin issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said.
                        Three new fatalities were recorded in Darrang, two in Nagaon -- police personnel who got washed away while trying to rescue marooned people -- and one each in Cachar, Dibrugarh, Hailakandi, Hojai, Kamrup and Lakhimpur.

AIR correspondent reports that  the ongoing second spate of floods in the Barak Valley has now submerged the whole city of Silchar within a high velocity flood water stream getting continuously flown out of the river Barak. Water-level inside the city is now varying up to eight feet in height and increasing while the water level of the Barak river at Annapurnaghat is decreasing, as river water is freely coming inside the city from multiple points. All the roads of the city have turned into waterways. Dead bodies cannot be cremated as the Burning Ghats and Burial Grounds are all under water.

                <h2 id="fifth">The Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati will help the Assam government in surveying the flood-affected areas by using drones developed by its startup to aid the relief and rescue work. According to officials, the state government has reached out to the institute to seek its expertise in surveying the flood-affected areas using drones to assess the condition in the villages where road connectivity has been disrupted due to the heavy flow of water.
        
                    The flood situation in Assam remained extremely critical on Sunday with many new localities coming under the impact of the deluge in several districts of the state and overnight incessant rain inundating more areas in Guwahati. Torrential rains for the past week have thrown normal life out of gear in parts of Assam. Landslides have also been reported from another half a dozen places in the city, including Kamakhya, Kharghuli, Hengerabari, Silpukhuri and Chandmari Colony.
                    
                    Knee-deep water and partially submerged vehicles on submerged roads were seen at many major intersections in the capital city. In some places, water levels even crossed the waist. The approach road of the Guwahati railway station was also inundated. "The government has approached us and we will be beginning the work as soon as possible. We will be using drones to survey the affected areas. Also, this exercise is important to help the government develop an action plan to prepare better ahead of the monsoon season considering the area is prone to floods and landslides due to its geographic location," Parmeshwar Iyer, Dean, IIT Guwahati.  </h2>
